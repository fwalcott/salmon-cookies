# salmon-cookies 

I have added CSS and other things to make it look pretty. Still not done with CSS. 
There is some trouble with app js in the footer and we keep getting strange numbers on the bottom. Three TA's Alex Pena, Merry Cimakasky and Ron Dumphy worked on this for about three hours and still no luck fixing this error.  

Set up a new branch. Added pictures and played with CSS some more.
